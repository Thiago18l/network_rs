# Network Automation

Network automation refers to the use of software tools and technologies to simplify and
automate the management, configuration, and operation of computer networks. It involves
leveraging various technologies, including machine learning, artificial intelligence, and
orchestration, to enable networks to operate more efficiently, accurately, and securely.
Network automation has evolved significantly over the years, driven by the need to reduce
complexity, improve reliability, and increase agility in network management.

In the early days of computer networking, network automation was limited to basic
scripting and command-line interfaces. This was a time-consuming and error-prone
process that required extensive manual intervention by network engineers. As networks
grew in complexity, it became increasingly challenging to manage them using these
traditional methods.
